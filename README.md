# Ethical Keystroke Logging Demo 🔐

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates an **ethical and educational implementation of keystroke logging** using Python.  
The application captures keystrokes **only within a controlled graphical user interface (GUI)** to ensure transparency, user awareness, and ethical usage.

This project is designed strictly for **cybersecurity learning and internship demonstration purposes**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To understand how keystroke logging works
- To demonstrate keystroke monitoring in a controlled environment
- To follow ethical cybersecurity practices
- To avoid unauthorized or global key capture

---

## ✨ Features
- GUI-based keystroke logging using Tkinter
- Start and Stop controls for logging
- Real-time keystroke capture within the application only
- Logs stored securely in a local text file
- Clear ethical disclaimer for educational use

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Tkinter (GUI library)**

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Open the project file using **Python IDLE**
2. Run the program (`F5`)
3. Click **Start Keylogger**
4. Type inside the text box
5. Keystrokes will be logged in `keystroke_log.txt`
6. Click **Stop Keylogger** to stop logging
